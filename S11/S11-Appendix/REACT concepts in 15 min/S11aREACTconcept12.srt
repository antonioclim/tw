1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,120
react is a JavaScript library full of

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,480
fancy terms like reconciliation

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,160
composition and error boundaries what do

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,240
all these terms actually mean let's

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,440
start from the beginning with components

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,000
components are the building blocks of

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,200
every react app they allow us to make

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
all the visible parts of our

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,720
applications like buttons inputs or even

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,560
entire Pages just like Legos you can use

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,119
components as many times as you want

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,080
every react component is a JavaScript

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,519
function that returns markup but since

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,720
react is is a JavaScript library react

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,559
components don't return HTML markup they

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,000
actually return something called jsx

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,120
which is Javascript in Disguise jsx is

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,480
optional but the alternative way to make

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,600
user interfaces is with the function

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,719
create element which gets annoying to

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,680
write pretty fast so everyone just uses

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,760
jsx since jsx is Javascript you can't

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,359
write attributes like you would in HTML

24
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,280
you have to write them in the camel case

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,079
style that means HTML attributes like

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,199
class become class name unlike HTML

27
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,840
which is static and unchanging the

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,080
benefit of using react is that you can

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,600
use Dynamic JavaScript values in your

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
jsx if you have data you can display it

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,080
in your jsx using curly braces curly

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,159
braces accept values like strings and

33
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,720
numbers directly you can use them to

34
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,320
make your attributes Dynamic and you can

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,000
style react elements using a JavaScript

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,920
object within the curly braces since

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,880
JavaScript functions can only return one

38
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,399
thing in react you can only return one

39
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,600
parent element from a component so you

40
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,680
can't do this without getting a big

41
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,920
error we could fix this by wrapping

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,079
these components in a div but maybe you

43
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,840
don't want to add another element to the

44
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,200
page instead you can use an empty

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,240
component called a react fragment okay

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,200
but what if I want to pass data into

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,360
another component for that you use

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,880
something called props to make a prop

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
create a name on the component you want

50
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,360
to pass data to and set it equal to some

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
value and that's it you can then use

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
that prop in the component you passed it

53
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,520
to props refers to properties on an

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,200
object which is what you get in the

55
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,720
parameters of each component to use the

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,480
prop take it from the object like a

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,879
normal JavaScript property think of them

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,840
like custom attributes you can add to

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,640
any component so wait can you pass

60
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,440
anything as a prop yes you can you can

61
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,519
even pass other components as props

62
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:28,879
using the children prop if you make

63
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,160
opening and closing tags for a component

64
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,400
you can pass other components in between

65
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,879
them these pass components are called

66
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,360
children and you can access them on the

67
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,640
children promp of the parent component

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,000
and it's great for something called

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,120
composition which is about organizing

70
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,239
our react components in the most optimal

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,480
way the children prop is really useful

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,920
for creating layout components when you

73
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,959
want your children to have the same

74
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,920
common layout the key prop is another

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,720
built-in prop to react and no unlike the

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,840
name implies it doesn't unlock anything

77
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,400
interesting the key prop is used so

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,840
react can tell one component apart from

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,040
another usually when you're creating a

80
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,080
list with the map function a key is just

81
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,879
a unique string or number to identify a

82
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,799
component you'll usually know when you

83
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,879
need to add a key because react will

84
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,599
warn you in the console fortunately if

85
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,319
you don't have a unique value for each

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,720
item you can always use the current

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,560
index from the map function but how does

88
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,040
react take all my amazing code and make

89
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,879
it display something in the browser that

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,480
process is called rendering react does

91
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,560
this for us but it's important to know

92
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,040
how it works because sometimes we can do

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,439
a bad thing and cause it to infinitely

94
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,799
reender which crashes our app the way

95
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,239
react knows how and when to render our

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,200
application is using something called

97
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,319
the virtual Dom also known as the vdom

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,959
okay but what does Dom mean Dom stands

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,799
for document object model which is what

100
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:02,720
every browser uses to model all the HTML

101
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,400
elements on a web page and when you draw

102
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,879
it out it kind of looks like a tree

103
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,000
here's the complete rendering process in

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,159
react if the state of our react app

105
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,760
changes then react updates the virtual

106
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,840
Dom which is quicker to update than the

107
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,959
real Dom then react uses a process

108
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,240
called diffing to compare the updated

109
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,720
virtual Dom to a previous version to see

110
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,000
what's changed once it sees what's

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,120
different react uses a process called

112
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,160
reconcil iation to update the real Dom

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,960
with the changes that it found whenever

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,680
someone uses our app tons of events take

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,960
place like clicks Mouse movements and

116
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,000
key presses many of which we need to

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
detect event handling is how we take

118
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,039
those user events and do something with

119
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,320
them react has a lot of built-in events

120
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,680
such as onclick onchange and onsubmit

121
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
these three events are ones you'll

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,720
probably use the most if we want to

123
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,400
alert users when a button is clicked we

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
would add the onclick prop to the button

125
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
and connect it to a function that would

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,320
show that

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,360
alert to manage data in our react apps

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,919
we need to use State not that kind of

129
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,639
state though state is like a snapshot

130
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,800
from a camera it's a picture of our app

131
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,320
at any given time to manage State we

132
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,840
also can't use JavaScript variables they

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,479
don't cause our app to render instead we

134
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,720
use special functions like use State and

135
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,160
use reducer use State takes an argument

136
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,360
that serves as the starting value value

137
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,919
of the state variable which is likes in

138
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,039
this example and returns an array

139
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,560
containing the state variable and a

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,479
function to update that state using our

141
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,800
button example we could also update the

142
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,479
number of times the button's been

143
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,960
clicked with the update function set

144
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,199
clicks and display it in the button with

145
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,080
the state variable

146
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,919
likes controlled components use State

147
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,199
values to have more predictable Behavior

148
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,840
here's an example of a controlled

149
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,120
component where the value typed into the

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
input is being put into State and

151
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,039
controlled by the state variable value

152
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,800
here's how it works the user types and

153
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,960
set value puts what the user typed into

154
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,319
State the state value is then updated

155
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,360
and finally the input uses that updated

156
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,280
State as its value controlled components

157
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,440
are a great pattern to use because if we

158
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,720
want to change the component's behavior

159
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
we just need to change the state that

160
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,840
controls it UST state is an example of a

161
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,280
react hook which allow us to hook into

162
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,840
features such as state within function

163
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,080
components there are five main types of

164
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,560
hooks State hooks like use State and use

165
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,680
reducer help you manage state within

166
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,599
react components context hooks such as

167
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:50,680
use context let you Ed data pass through

168
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,360
react context ref hooks such as use ref

169
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,840
let you reference things like HTML

170
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,840
elements effect hooks like use effect

171
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,680
let you connect with external systems

172
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,639
like browser apis and performance hooks

173
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,120
like use memo and use callback which can

174
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,840
improve performance by preventing

175
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,560
unnecessary work you'll use all of these

176
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,680
hooks at some point but the majority of

177
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,599
the time you'll likely use just three

178
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,400
hooks in your react components use State

179
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,759
use effect and use ref when you think of

180
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,560
the word purity you might think of

181
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,280
something like purified water Purity is

182
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
a term used to describe how react

183
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,520
components should work work but this

184
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,199
type of Purity is more like how

185
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,840
mathematical formulas are pure pure

186
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,720
react components mean that the same

187
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,599
input should always return the same

188
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,759
output to keep a react component pure

189
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
they should only return their jsx and

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,800
not change any objects or variables that

191
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,879
existed before rendering the cup

192
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,280
component in this example is impure

193
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,319
because it changes the variable count

194
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,000
during render which exists outside the

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,479
component this leads to the jsx have

196
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,960
having the wrong output when it is used

197
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,479
more than once to help make sure we

198
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,440
don't run into errors like this we can

199
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,720
use something called strict mode strict

200
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,560
mode is a special component which tells

201
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,840
us about mistakes as we develop our

202
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
react apps it's really convenient

203
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,840
because it's just a component we usually

204
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,319
wrap around our app component and it'll

205
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,479
tell us when we really shouldn't do

206
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,720
something but what if we need to do

207
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,240
something outside our react app your app

208
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,599
might need to talk with the browser API

209
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,360
or make a request to a server if you do

210
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,159
have an external system you're going to

211
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,200
need a way to step outside of react

212
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,320
effects are code that reach outside of

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,159
our react application usually effects

214
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,240
also known as side effects can be done

215
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,959
within event handlers for example to

216
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,640
make an HTTP request when you submit a

217
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,440
form or click on a button if you can't

218
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,880
run your effects within an event handler

219
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,600
then you can run them using the use

220
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,560
effect hook for example a common pattern

221
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,760
is to fetch dat data when components

222
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,000
first load with the use effect hook like

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,920
effects sometimes you want to step

224
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,480
outside react and work directly with the

225
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,519
Dom to reference an actual Dom element

226
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,959
you can use what's called a ref you can

227
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:16,519
create a ref with the Ed ref hook and to

228
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,120
get access to a Dom element use the ref

229
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,200
prop on any react element for some tasks

230
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,240
such as focusing an input it's much

231
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,200
easier to reference the actual Dom

232
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,440
element instead of attempting to do it

233
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,040
the react way

234
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,720
context is a powerful way to pass prop

235
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,200
data through your apps components most

236
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,279
react apps have tons of nested

237
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,720
components to get data down multiple

238
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,440
levels involves passing the same props

239
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
through components that don't actually

240
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,160
need it context lets us jump through the

241
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,920
component tree and use data at any level

242
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,720
without making props to use context you

243
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
first create context in a parent

244
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,120
component then wrap your parent

245
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,560
component in a special context component

246
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,360
called a context provider put the data

247
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,160
you want to pass down on the provider

248
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,399
and finally access that data in any

249
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,200
child component with the used context

250
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,000
hook portals on the other hand are kind

251
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,720
of like context but for components

252
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,680
portals let you move react components

253
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,000
into any HTML element you select portals

254
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,600
are great for components that can't be

255
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,240
displayed properly because of their

256
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
parents component styles for example for

257
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,399
displaying modals drop-down menus and

258
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,440
tool tips to create a portal just use

259
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,800
the create portal function pass your

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,480
component to it and choose the HTML

261
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,040
element where you'd like your react

262
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,920
component to appear suspense is a

263
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,560
special component that helps you handle

264
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,839
loading a component or its data suspense

265
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,880
is helpful for components that take some

266
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,519
time to fetch data it provides a better

267
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,720
user experience to show a fallback

268
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,920
component like a loading spinner until

269
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,560
the data is available instead of nothing

270
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
suspense is also useful if you're lazily

271
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,200
loading a component which lets us load a

272
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,320
component only when it's needed since

273
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,639
react apps are all JavaScript errors

274
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,560
that happen during rendering can totally

275
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,760
break your app airor boundaries are

276
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,440
components that let you catch app

277
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,279
breaking errors and show a fallback

278
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,279
component to tell the user about what

279
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,160
happened for example our app will crash

280
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,480
if we run this code because it throws an

281
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,959
error when there's no user to prevent

282
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,200
our app from crashing we'll first add an

283
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,320
error boundary to display a fallback

284
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,440
component with a more helpful error

285
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,680
message to be displayed to the user now

286
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
if you really want to dive deep into

287
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,000
react I've put together a complete boot

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,959
camp to help you master every one of

289
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,200
these Concepts from front to back you

290
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,639
can get started now at react boot camp.

291
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,440
I hope you learned a lot in this video

292
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,240
and I'll see you in the next one
